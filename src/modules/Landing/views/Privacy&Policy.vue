          6. As you use the Platforms, services, or purchase or arrange for the delivery of products, certain
          information may be passively collected:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Site Activity Information: We may keep track of some of the actions you take on the Platforms, such as the
            content of searches you perform on the Platforms;
          </li>
          <li>
            Access Device and Browser Information: When you access the Website from a computer or other device, we may
            collect anonymous information from that device, such as your Internet protocol address, browser type,
            connection speed and access times;
          </li>
          <li>
            Cookies (i.e. small pieces of information that a site sends to your browser while you are viewing a
            website): We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
            Cookies to make the Platforms and services easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect
            both you and ORA Group. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or
            to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept Cookies, however,
            you will not be able to stay logged in to the Platforms. We presently do not honour “Do Not Track” requests
            across all parts of our Platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Real-Time Location: Certain features of the Platforms use GPS technology to collect real-time information
            about the location of your device so that the Platforms can connect you to a healthcare
            professional/treatment provider near your location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Device information: We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device or computer. This
            information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of
            information that may be collected and used include how you use the application(s) and information about the
            type of device or computer you use. In addition, in the event our application(s) crashes on your mobile
            device we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which
            allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our application(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Web Analytics: We may use Google Analytics to help analyse how users use the Website. Google Analytics uses
            Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit, and what
            other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics
            only to improve our Website and services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on
            the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. Although
            Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next
            time you visit the Website, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and
            share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the Google
            Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

            To the relevant parties who may process your claims for your medical care (which may include your employer
            or your insurer if you are making claims under your employee or insurance benefits scheme or policy). In
            such circumstances, we may disclose your medical diagnosis/information to such parties for the purposes of
            claims processing and/or verification of utilisation, if required by such parties;
          </li>
          <li>
            To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound
            by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for
            which we disclose it to them (including logistics service providers, data service providers);
          </li>
          <li>
            As required by law, which can include providing information as required by a court order;

          <li>

        <p>
          8. The purposes listed in the above clauses may continue to apply even in situations where your relationship
          with us (for example, pursuant to your employment contract should you be hired) has been terminated or altered
          in any way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable us to enforce
          our rights under a contract with you).

          information collected by any third party. When you click on links on the Platform, you may leave our site. We

        <h2>WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT</h2>
        <p>
          10. The consent that you provide for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data will remain
          valid until such time it is being withdrawn by you in writing. You may withdraw consent and request us to stop
          collecting, using and/or disclosing your personal data for any or all of the purposes listed above by
          submitting your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent, we may require reasonable time (depending
          on the complexity of the request and its impact on our relationship with you) for your request to be processed
          and for us to notify you of the consequences of us acceding to the same, including any legal consequences
          which may affect your rights and liabilities to us. In general, we shall seek to process your request within
          ten (10) business days of receiving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please note that depending on the nature and
          scope of your request, we may not be in a position to continue providing our goods or services to you and we
          shall, in such circumstances, notify you before completing the processing of your request. Should you decide
          to cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing in the manner described in clause 10 above.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use and disclose
          personal data where such collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted or required under
          applicable laws. For the avoidance of doubt, such withdrawal of consent shall not require us to delete any
          personal data that has already been collected by us from our records. Such retention shall be subject to
          clauses 20 to 22 below.
        </p>

        <p>
          16. We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. In general, our response will be within

          receiving your request, we will inform you in writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be
          able to respond to your request. If we are unable to provide you with any personal data or to make a
          correction requested by you, we shall generally inform you of the reasons why we are unable to do so (except

          22. We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with
          you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the
          personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
