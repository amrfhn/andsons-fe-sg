  "description": "<span class='bold'>Why don’t men seek help from medical professionals?</span> Sometimes it’s uncomfortable to share what’s bothering us, or that we feel afraid of being judged. We want to change that. <br/><br/>For the next month, we’ll be creating a safe space for men to talk to our medical directors and learn about those difficult topics. We’ll face all health concerns – big or small – together. <br/><br/><span class='bold'>We are #MenInProgress</span>"
